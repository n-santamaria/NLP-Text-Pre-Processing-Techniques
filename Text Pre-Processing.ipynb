    "so to support his education, he would wake up early in the morning and ride a bicycle 3 kilometres from home to \n",
    "collect newspapers and sell them. He was admitted to St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli, and later he went on \n",
    "to complete a degree in physics in 1954 and then studied at the Madras Institute of Technology and graduated in \n",
    "aeronautical engineering in 1955. Since his childhood, Dr Abdul Alam wanted to be a pilot but couldn’t make his \n",

    "through his lectures and encouraged them to move forward.  ‘My vision for India’ was a Famous Speech of APJ \n",
    "Abdul Kalam delivered at IIT Hyderabad in 2011, and is to this day my favourite speech. His far-reaching \n",
